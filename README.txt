This directory is a library source for a simple multiplication function defined in C. See mul.c file for the program. The "run.sh" shell script can be used to compile this C program into a shared object file (.so file) on a Linux system. On Windows OS, follow the instructions given inside the windows-compile.txt file. This directory also contains a compiled and ready-to-use library inside the "thirdparty" directory. This "thirdparty" directory has to be used along with the Scilab test_toolbox that can be found at: https://github.com/FOSSEE/Scilab6-Test-Toolbox
